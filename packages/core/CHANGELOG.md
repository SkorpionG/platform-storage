# @platform-storage/core

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- A key can now declare the shapes it has had. `defineVersions(schema).next(schema, up)` builds a key definition that goes in the same schema object as any other, with each `up` typed against the version before it, and `.options(...)` adding `key`, `readFrom`, `default`, `onInvalid` and `recover` checked against the latest version.

  A versioned key stores `{ v, d }`, and every other key stays bare. A value written before the key had versions reads as version 1, so adopting versions needs no migration of its own. A read brings an older value forward one step at a time, validating at every step.

  Data the running code cannot judge is never destroyed. Where a stored version is newer than the code or a step fails, a read answers through the invalid-data policy, `"remove"` falls back instead of deleting, and `update` rejects.

  A migrated value is saved in the key's turn, never over a newer write, and a failed save still returns the migrated value and reports through `onError`. A versioned key found under a `readFrom` name runs its chain, and the latest version is what is written to the current name.

  A new `recover` option repairs a stored value the schema rejects and saves the repair. It keeps a key bare, receives the stored value as `unknown` or text that could not be parsed, runs after a version chain, and hands over to `onInvalid` when it answers `undefined`.

  Saving a migration or a `recover` result is not reported as a change. `watch` and `onChange` stay quiet, in the context that saved it and in any other tab or extension context seeing the same write.

  `InvalidContext.error` now includes the two new errors, which matters only to code that narrows it exhaustively.

  Before adopting versions on a key, drop the `"remove"` policy for it one release earlier, because a context still on older code sees an envelope as invalid data. Anything reading that key without this library has to understand the envelope, or the key can use `recover` and stay bare.

  Adds `StorageMigrationError` and `UnknownStorageVersionError`, with the codes `MIGRATION` and `UNKNOWN_VERSION`, and the types `VersionChain`, `VersionedKey`, `KeyVersion`, `StorageMigrationErrorOptions` and `UnknownStorageVersionErrorOptions`. A malformed chain is refused by `defineStorageSchema` with `StorageSchemaError`.

  `Immutable` now keeps a tuple a tuple, so a declared `default` for a tuple schema has to have its members in the right order.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 79a52f6: A storage now reports changes. `storage.watch(key, listener)` delivers the value before and after, read through the schema, and `storage.onChange(listener)` names the key that changed without reading anything. Both cover writes made through the storage and changes from other tabs or extension contexts.

  Adapters report what their backend can see through an optional `subscribe`: the web adapters follow the `storage` event, and the extension adapter follows `storage.onChanged`. AsyncStorage reports nothing, so React Native hears writes made through the same storage only.

  The React hooks follow every change by themselves while anything is mounted, so a value changed in another tab or context appears without further code. Writers gain `update`, which works out the next value from the current one. `notifyStorageChanged` is now needed only for a write made past the library.

  `STORAGE_OPERATION` gains `Subscribe`.

- 2ca9009: A key can now change where it is stored without losing what it holds: `readFrom` on a key definition lists the names it used to have, and a read that finds nothing at the current name moves a value found under one of them.

  `update` and `updateSync` work out a key's next value from its current one as a single step. The updater receives its own copy of the current value, so it may change it in place, and an update that fails leaves the stored value and the key's default as they were. Writes to one key through one storage now run in the order they were started, and `get` and `has` wait for writes already under way.

  Adapters can list every name a backend holds through an optional `keys`, and `keysSync` on the synchronous ones. The web, extension, React Native and memory adapters all offer it, the React Native one when the instance has `getAllKeys`.

  `withFallback` adapters gain `chosen()`, which says which half is in use without forcing the decision. `memoryAdapter` takes a `serializer`, so it can hold something other than text and be paired with an extension area, and copies values on the way in and out as a real backend does.

  `STORAGE_OPERATION` gains `Update` and `Keys`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7343ffd: Declare a storage schema once. Every read and write is then validated at runtime and typed at compile time.

  - `defineStorageSchema` maps each key to its validator, the name its backend stores under, its default, and its own invalid-data policy.
  - Keys and value types are both inferred from that one object, so nothing is restated at a call site.
  - Any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) validator works: Zod, Valibot, ArkType. None of them is a dependency, and nothing here imports one at runtime.
  - `createStorage` returns an asynchronous API, and adds `getSync` and its siblings when the adapter can answer immediately.
  - A stored value that no longer matches its schema falls back to the key's default rather than breaking the read.
  - Falling back is never silent: the `onError` observer sees every failure.
  - The invalid-data policy resolves per call, then per key, then per storage. `"throw"`, `"remove"` and a callback returning a replacement are the alternatives.
  - A missing value is always `undefined`, never `null`, because a schema may legitimately store `null`.
  - Values are stored bare, exactly as the schema produced them, with no envelope around them.
  - `clear()` removes only the keys the schema declares, so it can never wipe an origin shared with other code.
  - Every error extends `PlatformStorageError` and carries a stable `code`. Prefer `isPlatformStorageError` to `instanceof`, which stops matching across two resolved copies of the package.
  - Adapter authors get the `StorageAdapter` contract, `defineSyncAdapter`, `requireBackend`, `withFallback` and `memoryAdapter`.
